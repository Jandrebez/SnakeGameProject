//Snake Game
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java using the Swing library for graphical user interface components. In this game, players control a snake that moves around a grid, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls. The objective is to grow the snake as long as possible without hitting any obstacles.

//Features:
Snake Movement: Control the direction of the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Food Placement: Randomly place food on the grid for the snake to eat.

//Scoring: Keep track of the player's score, which increases as the snake eats food.
Game Over: End the game if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
Graphics: Display the game elements using simple graphical shapes and colors.

//How to Play:
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
Guide the snake to eat food, which appears randomly on the grid.
Avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the walls.
The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
Try to achieve the highest score possible before the game ends.

//Instructions for Running the Game:
Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
Compile the SnakeGame.java file.
Run the compiled Java class file to start the game.
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake.

//About:
This project serves as a fun exercise in Java programming and basic game development concepts. It demonstrates the use of Swing for creating a simple graphical interface and implementing game logic.
